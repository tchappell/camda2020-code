# camda2020-code
Code for the CAMDA 2020 geolocation challenge

Requires a C++ compiler, OpenMP and the Eigen library.

The `s` program is used to convert FASTQ-format sequences into signatures and cluster them.

The `p` program is used to geolocate files of clustered signatures through leave-one-out search.

The programs are designed specifically for working with the CAMDA2020 data and will require modification for use with other data. Use at your own risk!
